# SR Code Challenge(s)

- Please duplicate the repository https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/duplicating-a-repository
- You have 90 minutes total to complete all tasks in this repo.
- Please commit after finishing each task. You can commit more often than this but no less.
- We recommend you quickly check each task before beginning any of them.
- You're very welcome to keep going after the 90 minutes (if you want, no pressure) but we do ask that you make a commit at 90 minutes so we can see your progress.
- Once you've finished please push it back to github, set it as private and provide username `tenzerothree` with access.

Thanks for taking the time to do this. I know it's not fun but it is appreciated.
