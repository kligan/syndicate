# CSS Challenge
In this folder there should be 2 files, `index.html` and `style.css`.

Your task, if you choose to accept it (but choosing not to might not be great), is to recreate the image below by editing the `style.css` file.

## Rules
- Do not modify the `index.html` file in any way
- You may not style the `html`, `body` `head` or `link` elements, **ONLY** the `a` element
- Do not pass GO
- You may style pseudo elements but only of the `a` element.
