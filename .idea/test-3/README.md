# Array Transformation

In this directory there is a file named `code.js`.

Edit the code so that `output` is a new array containing:

- The values in `words` that have more than 6 letters.
- These values should also be converted to uppercase.
- The `output` array should start with a string `Start:`

With the given `words` input then, the result should be:

```js
['Start:', 'EXUBERANT', 'DESTRUCTION', 'PRESENT']
```

## Rules

- Try to do this as efficiently as possible: this means creating as few arrays and loops as possible
- You may not change `words`
